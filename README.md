# Demo Presentation

This project contains an example [RevealJS](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) presentation demonstrating just a few of the features provided by this awesome presentation framework.

See the [blog post](https://danielabaron.me/blog/build-and-publish-presentation-with-html-and-css/) that walks through how to get started with the framework, create an example presentation, and publish it to Github Pages.
